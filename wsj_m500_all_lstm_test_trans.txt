DRAVO LAST MONTH AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO SELL ITS INLAND WATER TRANSPORTATION STEVEDORING AND PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESSES FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM
THE COMBINED BUSINESSES ACCOUNTED FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF DRAVO'S EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE REVENUE
IN SEPTEMBER THE COMPANY RECEIVED NINETY SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AS ITS SHARE OF DAMAGES FROM A BREACH OF CONTRACT AWARD RELATED TO A COAL PARTNERSHIP
SOUTH AFRICA THE SOLUTION BY FRANCES KENDALL AND LEON LOUW HAS SOLD OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COPIES SINCE LAST YEAR
AS MS. KENDALL AND MR. LOUW SEE IT SOUTH AFRICA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IS LIKE A BIG LUMBERING TANK
WHITE BUREAUCRATS ARE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND BLACKS RIGHTLY FEAR WHAT THE TANK'S WEAPONS CAN DO TO THEM
MANY WANT TO STORM THE TANK AND TAKE IT OVER
BUT IF THE HISTORY OF OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS IS ANY GUIDE WHITES INDIANS AND SMALL BLACK TRIBES SHOULD FEAR THAT
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS MOST CORN AND WHEAT FUTURES PRICES WERE STRONGER
WHEAT FUTURES WERE SUPPORTED BY CONCERN THAT WHEAT MAY BE VULNERABLE IF COLD SNAPS FOLLOW THIS PAST WEEKEND'S WARMTH ANALYSTS SAID
THE WARMING TREND MAY HAVE MELTED THE SNOW COVER ON SOME CROPS
CORN FUTURES RECEIVED SOME STRENGTH ON EXPECTATION THAT THE AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT WOULD RAISE SOVIET IMPORT FORECASTS ANALYSTS SAID
AFTER THE CLOSE OF TRADING THE FORECASTS WERE INCREASED
SOYBEAN FUTURES PRICES WERE MIXED WITH BEANS AND OIL FINISHING HIGHER
STRONGER PALM OIL PRICES HELPED OIL PRICES FIRM ANALYSTS SAID
CONTACTS STILL INSIDE OWENS CORNING HELP TOO
MR. COLLINS LEARNED THAT AN OWENS CORNING DIVISION WAS REDUCING ITS STAFF AND WOULD NEED OUTSIDE HELP TO PRODUCE A NEWSLETTER
HE MADE A SALES CALL HE SAYS
IT WASN'T A GIVEAWAY
I SAT DOWN AND FIGURED OUT WHAT THEY NEEDED AND SOLD THEM ON IT
THE SENSE OF IMPENDING DOOM HAS STYMIED TEAMWORK THEY SAY
THERE WAS A LOT MORE HELPING OUT AND SHARING BEFORE SAYS BILL K. THE CREDIT MANAGER
TODAY HE SAYS THE ATTITUDE IS I'VE GOT MY JOB AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR JOB
ADDS JIM A DIVISION MANAGER FOR A RETAILER IT'S A DOG EAT DOG WORLD
MR. HOLMES A COURT SAID HE PLANS TO REVIEW THE STRUCTURE OF BELL GROUP
IT MAY BE THAT OUR STRUCTURE AND MULTIPLICITY OF CORPORATIONS ISN'T THE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE FUTURE
NO FIRM PLAN HAS BEEN DEVISED BUT IT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION TO REVIEW THE WHOLE STRUCTURE HE SAID
THE PEOPLE'S PARTY CADRE MOVED INTO KEY POSITIONS IN AREAS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING HEALTH EDUCATION LABOR FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AGRICULTURE
THIS ALLOWED IT TO PLACE MORE OF ITS CADRE IN THE PANAMANIAN BUREAUCRACY
NUMEROUS COMRADES WERE APPOINTED MOST OF WHOM GRADUATED FROM UNIVERSITIES IN COMMUNIST BLOC NATIONS
AS WITH THE REST OF THE REGIME HOWEVER THEIR IDEOLOGY BECAME CONTAMINATED BY THE GERM OF CORRUPTION
THIS WAS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THE POLITICAL LABOR AND STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS WHICH UNCONDITIONALLY SURRENDERED TO THE DEFENSE FORCES
THE SAGA BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN PENNZOIL SUED TEXACO OVER ITS ACQUISITION OF GETTY OIL
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE PENNZOIL WON NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES AT TRIAL THE BIGGEST JUDGMENT EVER AWARDED A PLAINTIFF
THE TWO COMPANIES AGREED TO SETTLE THE CASE FOR THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LATE DECEMBER
PENNZOIL HAS BEEN FRETTING OVER THE DETAILS OF MOVING THE MONEY EVER SINCE
SUMMITS HAVE THEIR POLITICAL BENEFITS OF COURSE NOT LEAST THAT THE PRESIDENT DOMINATES THE NEWS
VICE PRESIDENT BUSH MUST BE ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE CHANGE OF SUBJECT ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN THE DRUMBEAT ABOUT PANAMA AND GENERAL NORIEGA
BUT HAVING TALKED TO A VARIETY OF REPUBLICANS ABOUT THIS IN RECENT WEEKS I'M CONVINCED THAT MORE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THIS PARADOX OF DETENTE THAN PUBLICLY LET ON
THERE'S NO DOUBT WE'VE DIMINISHED THE SOVIET THREAT VERY SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE LAST YEAR SAYS MINNESOTA REPRESENTATIVE VIN WEBER
BUT THERE ARE ALSO RISKS
